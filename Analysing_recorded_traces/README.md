**TRS.py** script uses [trsfile](https://github.com/Riscure/python-trsfile) (a library published by [Riscure's Inspector](https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-sca/)) for extracting traces, data and ... from trs files (Written by Nima Mahdion).
With this script, it is possible to open and read a "_**.trs**_" file, print the cryptographic data sush as Plaintext and Ciphertext and also plot leakage traces  

**add_plaintext_samples_to_CSV.py**, adds the first byte of plaintexts and the corresponding traces to a "_**CSV**_" file.
